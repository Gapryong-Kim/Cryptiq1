# No, nothing , nyet. If I was to have a comment, It would only be to exemplify my lack of exactly that; thus being a comment in and of itself. This begs the all-important question: If I comment on my lack of comment, is this a comment? Or merely a pale shadow, an imitation, a forgery, a fake, fricatively phoney? This is a question I am as yet unable to answer, though in the pursuit of an answer I have discovered many an interesting factoid: did you know Australia is wider than the moon? I most certainly did not, though I think it to be less my lack of knowing, and more my lack of musing. This is my comment, and my testament.
